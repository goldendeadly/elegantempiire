## Welcome to the Markdown Content System

This is a test article created to verify that the new Markdown-based content system is working correctly.

### Key Features

This system allows you to:

- Write articles in simple Markdown format
- Add frontmatter metadata (title, description, date, tags)
- Deploy quickly without full site rebuilds
- Scale to hundreds of articles efficiently

### How It Works

1. Create a `.md` file in `src/content/articles/`
2. Add frontmatter at the top
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Commit and push to GitHub
5. Vercel deploys in seconds

### Cost Efficiency

This approach is significantly more credit-efficient than creating individual React components for each article.

**If you can read this article at `/articles/test-article`, the system is working!**
